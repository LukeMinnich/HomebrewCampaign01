### Character Creation

What is the [campaign glue] that will be necessary to tie everything together?  What is the contract that everyone agrees to when they start out, that, if violated, will need to be course-corrected lest the PC be incompatible with the motivation of the other PCs.

### Campaign Glue

* Common Goal
  * Help others rise up and overthrow oppression

### Player Restrictions

* No evil alignments
* Limit profanity to reasonable levels, in good fun
* If choosing a gender not your own, be careful to avoid stereotypes, and be sensitive to others at the table when 
* All published D&D 5e material is fair game.  Will consider Unearthed Arcana on a case-by-case basis.
* Classes can be tweaked - if you feel you would like to play a character concept but think it would be too weak or doesn't match an existing subclass, let's talk.
* If planning to play a Cleric, Paladin, let's talk plan out the diety of your worship
* If plannng to play a Warlock, let's talk and decide if that's best.  Due to the nature of having a Patron, it requires substantial planning to get character progression right.

### Story Restrictions

* No dark sexual themes without first polling the players as to their comfort level
