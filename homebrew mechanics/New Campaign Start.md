# New Campaign Start

### Premise

The players are a group of closet dissidents called to action by bearing witness to acts of oppression.  During the campaign, they uncover political, historical, and arcane secrets to unravel the machinations of those wielding power in an authoritarian regime.

The campaign takes place in a world technologically similar to the that of the United States at the turn of the nineteenth century, with some modifications made for game balance and to aid with suspension of disbelief.

Uniquely, this campaign will use real current events as source material, a la South Park.
