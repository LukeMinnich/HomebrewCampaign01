 # All Aboard the Selmy Express

An 5th Edition D&D adventure for 4 to 6 level 1 adventurers.

### Overview and Motivation

This adventure is intended to introduce new players to many concepts typical to tabletop RPGs.   There are opportunities for combat, investigative puzzle-solving, and navigating a sticky social situation.

The adventure starts off on a literal railroad.  The players will be given the chance to settle in, make introductions, exhibit their personalities, and interact with a handful of NPCs.  About 2/3 the way through the journey, a series of events unfolds, culiminating in [The Heist]. as they might be [getting mixed up in things].

Before the train reaches its terminus at [Selmy], any number of players are detained as witnesses or suspects. The witnesses are taken in for questioning, while the suspects are transported under guard to the town sheriff and potentially imprisoned, depending on the liklihood of their involvement with the [the Heist].

Any players hanging around the sheriff's office will be enaged by [Inquisitor Candice].  Any suspects will be released into her custody by [Sheriff Rollins], provided they agree to some [terms of conditional release].

The players will be allowed to investigate the train.  Some sleuthing can lead to any number of clues implicating several onboard.  Some may confess when threatened with jailtime.  The players can discover a hideout belonging to the thieves under the employ of the [Spark of Life].

Infiltrating the thieves' hideout involves trap avoidance and encounters with some mooks.  Along the way the party members could uncover secrets relating to their deities or patrons or magical secrets as a hook for the next part of the journey.

The final encounter is with the thieves who robbed the train, with [Morgan Cheerwine] as the ringleader.  They will be in process of moving the stolen goods on powered minecarts, and the players will have to choose whether to chase down the goods or finish off the encounter with the BBEG.  Attempting to do both may lead to the capture and enslavement of the remaining players.

Upon successful return of the goods, the players who had been suspects will be pardoned.  If the players defeated the BBEG without recovering the goods, they will suffer consequences at the hands of the law.
