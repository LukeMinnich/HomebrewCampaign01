### Beneath the Giddyup Saloon

* A door beneath the stair leads down to the cellar

##### Cellar
> You descend the stairs, entering a subterranean cellar.  Rats scurry away from the light as you reach the bottom.  Barrels, sacks, and crates are stacked and crowd the small space. There appears to be a meandering walking path between the piles.

* There is a bare part of wall that signifies a secret door
* There are (2) levers and a button hidden on the opposite wall.
    * The left lever is currently down (deactivated).  It opens the secret passagway.
    * The button (middle) serves as part of the alarm system and will cause a light to blink for 10 seconds in all passages except this one
    * The right lever is currently up (active). It enables the bloody place setting in the next hall, which bypasses all threats between here and the interrogation room.
    * Activating on lever will automatically deactivate the other.
    * The players only raised the left lever, which opened the door

##### Corridor of Many Sets
> This low-ceilinged passageway leads to the south.  It is flanked to either side by a pair of alcoves, or perhaps dining nooks. Within the nooks are:
    * Northeast - A chess set
        * The pieces are at the home positions
        * The spirit of a chess grandmaster, Shira Ward, is sealed away in the set and will communicate telepathically with anyone who touches one of the pieces or the board
        * The spirit is magically bound to play at the best of her ability, requiring (3) successful DC15 intelligence or DC20 charisma checks to beat her, over the course of several games.  If a check is a success, she will win but say that the player is improving. XX
        * The chess board can be taken with the players.  The pieces will remain affixed to it.
        * Upon the third successful check, the grandmaster will be beaten and teleported, spirit and body, adjacent to the chessboard
    * Northwest - A plaid black and white settee
        * It is fairly comfortable
        * It has no special purpose
    * Southeast - A tea set
        * (4) cups are arranged neatly around the table and are fixed in position
        * There is tea strangely preserved in a magical canning jar
        * There is no water
        * Providing water, heating the teapot, pouring the tea in the four cups, and sitting in the (4) chairs will release the tea cups and heal each player for 2d8
        * This ritual can be performed only once per day
    * Southwest - A place setting for two
        * Beneath the covered platter is the table surface, painted like a silver tray, covered in blood
        * A DC15 investigation check reveals that runes are etched beneath the paint. The will be glowing if the right lever in the Cellar is currently up
        * An offering of 1 hp will open the Auxiliary Passageway if the runes are active

#### Path A - through the fire and flames

##### Two Lies and a Truth
> You enter what may once have been an antechamber to a noble household. To your flanks, frayed, faded tapestries emit a musty stench. In front of you, opposite the northern door, three reliefs are set into the stonework.  Each one depicts a lovely, young elven woman.  They are all similar, yet slightly different in age.
* Upon approaching the middle of the chamber, a beautiful voice will ring out

> You who enter the Halls of Hercend: what do you seek?
* Anything about passage through will automatically open a door to the west.
* Anything about power, magic, or wealth will prompt the following puzzle:

> Only one of us tells the truth.  Confront the liars and be rewarded.
* Youngest daughter:
    * I beckon you, oh hear me, it is I who holds the key
* Middle daughter:
    * Locks and cuffs hold me at bay, you see, for I do not hold the key
* Eldest daughter:
    * My youngest sister, vibrant though she may be, does not hold the key

* Solution: the Middle daughter holds the key

* Resolution:
    * If the party guesses correctly, the middle relief splits in half, revealing treasure a room beyond
    * If the party guess falsely, a trap door opens beneath each of the two players, leading to a 20' fall onto spikes, which deals 2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 piercing damage, and the puzzle cannot be attempted for another 24 hours, whereupon the puzzle changes slightly. The fall can be prevented by a DC15 Acrobatics check.  The trap doors are otherwise not detectable.

##### Treasure Room
> A solitary pedestal sits smack dab in the middle of the room.  Atop the pedestal sits what appears to be a skull, motionless, facing away from the entrance.  The skull is wreathed in a low-burning green flame.

    * The skull is in fact a Flameskull, and will turn to face the party in combat if touched or if it any creatures enters its FOV
    * Upon defeating the Flameskull, it will say 'Good job,' give a wink, and fall to pieces
    * A recess on the top of the pedestal will open, revealing a 'Ring of the Grammarian'

##### Room of the Dance
> A lively jig emanates from the chamber within.  Peering inside, you spot a three-piece string band: violin, viola, and cello, being played by... no one.  A closed door exits to the west.  On the floor among the instruments sits a long dead skeleton sprawled on a rug.  It wears the remnants of what looks like a sheriff's outfit, complete with badge

* If anyone approaches the instruments while able to hear, they must immediately drop what they are doing and start shuffling, tapping their feet, and capering to the music, as if affected by an Otto's Irresistible Dance spell. To break the spell, they must succeed on a DC15 Wisdom saving throw.
* The instruments are magical, but can be made inert for a time by dispelling magic, as though dispelling a 6th level spell.  If removed from the room, they lose their magical properties.
* The skeleton holds a plastic sheriff's badge, a magical item

##### Prison Cells
> (5) barred prison cells sit unoccupied, their doors adjar.  The cloying stench of a rotting corpse hangs in the air. An iron door exits to the west; a wooden door is embedded in the east wall.

* The party will come across the cells unoccopied.  Closer inspection to one of the cells will reveal that it has been in recent use - there is a chamber pot in need of emptying.
* A DC12 medicine check will reveal that the corpse has been dead for at least a month.  A check of 18 or higher will reveal it died of starvation.

##### Arcane Armory
> The heavy iron swivels loudly on its hinges as light cascades into the room. 

* The room is being used to store a fair bit of the Credenza's wealth
    * 
    * Half of the Platinum trade bars (5 x 100gp value) stolen from the Selmy Express
    * A __Deck of Illusions__, missing (5) cards, for a total of 29

#### Path B - direct to the interrogation room

##### Secret corridor
> You enter an unlit passageway with a high ceiling to the west. Three wrought-iron wall-mounted basins hang along the northern wall.  An acrid smell assaults your senses.
    * A door at the far end of the passageway is just out of view unless a light source is provided
    * Anyone who fully enters the passageway will need to hold their breath or make a DC12 Con saving throw against the gases emitted by the basins.  A failed save -> player become poisoned for 10 minutes.
    * By the door, there is a hidden button requiring a DC15 perception check which unlocks the door.
    * Otherwise the door can be opened with a DC18 thieves' tools check or DC18 athletics check. Either of these options will alert the people in the chamber beyond

##### Interrogation room / Torture chamber
> Two chairs sit opposite another amidst a sea of torture devices.  Seated in one, in a daze, you see a familiar face - Carina.  Opposite her
