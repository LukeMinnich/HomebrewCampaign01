### Aftermath of Plaster fight
* The party stayed up all night, therefore they'll be exhausted if they don't sleep
* They know the Spark of Life hired Plaster as a bounty hunter to bring them in dead or alive.
    * Would they have singled out anyone specific to not leave alive.
* Plaster's home can be found by asking around for someone meeting his description, but that will likely lead them into the jaws of his employers (not pursued by players)
* The Spark of Life will lay low for the day before the festival, since that is when they hatch their plan

### The Fence - Carina
* The fence has been captured and is being interrogated by the Credenza mafia
* She is being kept under guard in a restaurant - the one with the neon cowboy sign (the Giddyup saloon)
* The Credenza
    * Are being paid well by the Spark of Life to silence curious folks in Aorta
* She will vouch for the party to the council if rescued
* She did some of her own cross-interrogation to discover that the Spark of Life has something big planned to take place at the festival

### The Spook
* Boris, a doppleganger, runs the Giddyup Saloon
* The restaurant is run by a Doppleganger named "Boris" who makes himself look like Sam Elliott 
* His waitstaff and cookstaff are none the wiser
* Boris has worked out an agreement with the Credenza, so he is well financed

### The Hypnotist
* Jane Zeen, a copper dragonborn sorceror, who uses Charm spells and psychology and hypnosis to rewire people's brains, making them docile and compliant for interrogation
* She grew up in the capital and was in training at the University there, but was thrown out for "fucking with her classmates' heads"
* Is trying to extract info from Carina but having difficuly against her unexpectedly iron will
* Will flee at around half health - she has bigger plans than dying in Aorta
* Currently employed for her special skills by the Credenza family

### The Ghost - Murphy Graves
* He will not rest until his murderer is "brought to justice"
* Need to flesh out his kids' backstory.  Are they basically Hitler youth? Brainwashed by the Spark of Life into service because he was unable to raise them well without their mother?

### The Council
* The council is motivated by preserving Aorta as a bastion of freedom from the Empire
* The council is concerned with a couple things
    * Continual threats by Minerva above, that they will come relocate the citizens of Aorta
    * Sanitation
    * Poverty
    * Hunger, especially since there are whispers of a province-wide food shortage
    * Protection from the criminal element (mafia)
    * Technological advancement - they have been approached by Teknologik for some special subterranean project
* They will hire the party on as bodyguards for the festival for some VIP's during the festival
    * One of those VIP's will have the trade bars stashed in his room, evidence from the Semly Express robbery (half are gone, so only 5 x 100gp remain)
