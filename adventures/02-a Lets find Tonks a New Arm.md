Where is it reasonable that she could get a new arm?
* 7th Level Restoration Spell. Will require tracking down a high level Cleric or Druid. If that's the route they go, the caster will have a job for them to tackle before offering up their services. These people are rare in the world, and they are not just willing to heal random strangers.
* A mechanical/magical prostethic. Less than ideal, the new techonology is available to those with coin in the city of Plenaru. There are several models, each with their own reliability and price point. All models require regular maintenance and training to use as an extension of the body. Some example models:
    * Base model: crafted of sturdy oak, this weighty limb is infused with raw magical essense that links it to the user's mind. Removes movement and other combat penalties relating to dismemberment. _Requires attunement_.
    * Gear model: Servos whizz as you deftly waggle your new limb.  It seems lighter than the base model, and considerably more durable, being comprised of steel. _Side Affects_ This one is not so easy to don and doff as the base model, requiring minor surgery to create a sort of _socket_.
    * Deluxe model: Energy pulses through this skeletonized limb. Featherweight. Waterproof. Cannot be damaged by physical means.  Unarmed strikes can deal 1d4 + Strength modifier. Attacks are considered magical. Functions as a buckler (+1 AC). _Turbo_: once per short rest, you can use an action to activate a thruster mounted in the elbow to make an melee attacked, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Proficiency and to-hit bonus are at the DM's discretion.
* A patron comes to Tonks in a vision, describing a source of magic than can restore her. Little does she know that persuing such path will release
