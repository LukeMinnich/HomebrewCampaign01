"Fork In The Road"
I came to a fork in the road.
I could have went left.
I could have went right.
But i just turned around.

See,
If i went left, down that path,
some might have,
Picked at my insecurities and laughed,
I may have tripped on a branch and crashed,
The grim reaper could have slashed,
My brains could have been Smashed.

If i went right, down that path,
Who knows what may lie,
Might be a hot, sweet pumpkin pie,
A warm, voluptuous woman willing to give me a try,
A shoulder on which when hurt I could cry,
Shelter from weather so I could stay dry,
Or love,
an everlasting supply.

But those paths could also be vice versa.
And I'd have no way to know.
so I realized that when I came to the fork,
I had to think consequentially.

So when I say "I just turned around",
I wasn't running due to confusion, or in need of protection,
I simply turned to ask for help,
I needed some direction
